# Contributing to Ubilabs Google Maps React Hooks

We are happy you came here and thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰ 

To get started there are some things that need to be set up.

----

## Setting Up Dev Environment

We will work on the `develop` branch. 


We use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage the dependencies.

### Fork the repo and start building

All new features and bug-fixes should be branched off and merged into the `develop` branch.

#### Follow these steps to get started:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [Google Maps React Hooks](https://github.com/ubilabs/google-maps-react-hooks)).

2. Clone your fork locally

```bash
# In a terminal, cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, then
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/google-maps-react-hooks.git

# cd to the google-maps-react-hooks directory
cd google-maps-react-hooks

# Checkout the develop branch
git checkout develop
```

3. At the root directory of the project on the develop branch, install all dependencies and build.
```bash
# Install dependencies 
npm install

# Start the project locally before changing code
npm run start:library
```

4. Create a new branch where to make code changes.

```bash
# Make sure you are on the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature-branch
```

5. To see example cases of the Google Maps react hooks, checkout the [Examples Folder](./examples). To start an example:
```bash
# If not done already: Go to 'google-maps-react-hooks' directory and run:
npm install

# Run an example (look at the different examples for their start scripts):
npm run start:sample-map
```

Then open [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) in a browser.
